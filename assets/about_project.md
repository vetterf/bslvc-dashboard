# About the Project

## The Bamberg Survey of Language Variation and Change (BSLVC)

The Bamberg Survey of Language Variation and Change (BSLVC) is a comprehensive research project investigating morphosyntactic and lexical variation across World Englishes. Through systematic data collection from speakers of English varieties worldwide, the BSLVC contributes to our understanding of synchronic variation patterns and their sociolinguistic conditioning.

---

## Project Overview

### Research Objectives

The BSLVC pursues three primary research objectives:

1. **Documenting Variation**: Systematically record morphosyntactic and lexical variation across English varieties representing different acquisition contexts (English as a Native Language [ENL], English as a Second Language [ESL], and English as a Foreign Language [EFL])

2. **Sociolinguistic Analysis**: Investigate the relationship between linguistic variation and social factors including age, gender, education, geographic mobility, and language exposure patterns

3. **Theoretical Contribution**: Advance theoretical understanding of language variation and change by providing empirical evidence for models of World Englishes, including the Dynamic Model and competing theoretical frameworks

### Key Features

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Data from speakers of English varieties across six continents
- **Systematic Sampling**: Stratified sampling ensuring representation across major variety types
- **Mixed Methods**: Combining quantitative acceptability judgment tasks with sociodemographic surveys
- **Open Science**: Commitment to data accessibility and methodological transparency
- **Reproducible Research**: Interactive dashboard enabling replication and extension of published analyses

## Project History

### Origins

The BSLVC project was initiated in [YEAR] at the University of Bamberg, Germany, building on the tradition of large-scale variationist surveys such as the International Corpus of English (ICE) and the electronic World Atlas of Varieties of English (eWAVE).

### Development Phases

**Phase 1: Design and Piloting** ([YEAR]-[YEAR])
- Grammatical feature selection based on linguistic theory and eWAVE documentation
- Questionnaire design and pilot testing
- Methodological refinement

**Phase 2: Data Collection** ([YEAR]-[YEAR])
- Online survey deployment
- Participant recruitment through institutional partnerships and social media
- Quality control and data validation

**Phase 3: Analysis and Dissemination** ([YEAR]-Present)
- Statistical analysis and pattern identification
- Publication of findings in peer-reviewed journals
- Development of interactive dashboard for community access

## Related Projects

### The electronic World Atlas of Varieties of English (eWAVE)

The BSLVC builds on the foundational work of eWAVE, which provided the first comprehensive documentation of morphosyntactic features across English varieties. Our grammatical feature selection was informed by eWAVE's feature inventory.

### International Corpus of English (ICE)

ICE established methodological standards for variety-comparative corpus linguistics. The BSLVC complements ICE by focusing on acceptability judgments rather than corpus attestation.
