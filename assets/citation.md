## Citing Specific Analyses

### UMAP Visualizations

When reporting UMAP projections, specify the hyperparameters used:

**Example**:
> "Dimensionality reduction was performed using UMAP (McInnes et al., 2018) as 
> implemented in the BSLVC Dashboard (Author et al., Year), with the following 
> parameters: n_neighbors=15, min_dist=0.1, metric='euclidean'."

When reporting Random Forest analyses, specify the implementation:

**Example**:
> "Feature importance rankings were computed using Random Forest classification 
> (Breiman, 2001) via scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) as implemented in 
> the BSLVC Dashboard (Author et al., Year)."
