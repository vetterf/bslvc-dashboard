# BSLVC Dashboard

The BSLVC dashboard is an interactive visualization that allows researchers to explore the Bamberg Survey of Language Variation and Change (BSLVC; https://www.uni-bamberg.de/en/eng-ling/forschung/the-bslvc-project-dfg-funded/) data. As the BSLVC is not yet published, the repository does not contain the necessary sqlite database file. However, a password-protected live version of the dashboard is available (see Quick Start below).

## Quick Start

Visit the [live dashboard](https://bslvc.eng-ling.uni-bamberg.de). The getting started section contains instructions how you can work with the dashboard.
As the dashboard is still in demo mode until the release of the BSLVC database, please contact Fabian Vetter if you want access to the demo version.

For details on all available functions, see the documentation.
